# Inspiration

### This self-motivated independent  project aims to develop a web application for sentimental analysis of a trend or a topic for someone who  likes to know what's happening around and how one's trend or specific topic is doing on the internet. The project is divided into three parts collecting, developing, and deploying.This solution for evaluating Twitter data is to perform better business decisions and keep tracking all relevant Twitter data about a brand in real-time, perform analysis as topics or issues emerge. By monitoring brand mentions on Twitter, brands could inform management and deliver better experiences for their customers across the word

 # Collecting Data

### Collecting data is a necessary part of this project. I  used Twitter API to collect the data from the server . The Twitter API lets you read and write Twitter data. Thus, you can use it to compose tweets, read profiles, and access your followersâ€™ data and a high volume of tweets on particular subjects in specific locations. API stands for Application Programming Interface. This software provides "middleman services" between two applications that want to communicate with each other. Any requests you make go to the server first and the response given comes through the same route. one can read documents of Twitter [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)

## Twitter api

### To get work with api we need some way to connect to the server to connect 
  # Go to http://apps.twitter.com and create an app.
  # The consumer key and secret will be generated for you
  API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  API_SECRET_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

  # After the step above, you will be redirected to your app's page.
  # Create an access token under the the "Your access token" section
  ACCESS_TOEKN = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
